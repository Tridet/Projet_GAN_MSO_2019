# Dataset Vocabulary

* The `vocabulary.py` function generates all the vocabulary present in the descriptive texts related to the images of the datasets[Birds 200](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html}{Caltech-UCSD) and[Flowers](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/). Descriptions in `.txt` format are available for download on the Reed Scoot github in the repository[cvpr2016](https://github.com/reedscot/cvpr2016).

* However, since the datasets in question are very heavy, the vocabularies for each dataset as well as the number of occurrences of each word are available in the `.json` files

* The `vocabulary.py` function also allows you to generate different insights from these vocabularies. Some of them are presented in the barplots below.
